# Flood-Risk-Assessment

This project is a GIS analysis conducted to improve the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) by FEMA.
This project won the GIS Day Savannah competition, organized by the Savannah Area Geographic Information System (SAGIS) in 2023.

## Aim

Flooding is an overflowing of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods can happen during heavy rains, when ocean waves come on shore, when snow melts quickly, or when dams or levees break. Floods are the most common and widespread of all weather-related natural disasters. (NOAA, 2022). The Study area of this project is Franklin County, Ohio. It is the most populous county in Ohio, and according to the Columbus public health department, Flooding is the third biggest hazard to residents
By leveraging GIS techniques, Flood risk maps can be created to improve the assessment of FEMA's product


## Resource used
* ArcGIS
* Digital Elevation Model dataset (from USGS)
* Land Use and Land Cover data (from ESRI)
* The precipitation data (from CHRS)
* Soil data (from USDA)
* Flood Insurance Rate Map (from FEMA)
* Population and administrative boundary dataset (from Cemsu)

## Conclusion
About of 40% of the total land mass of Franklin County is susceptible to high rates of flooding events. Also, more than 60% of the entire county has already recorded human activities and density.
This can be easily deduced from the land use map. These analysis raises a big concern for the residents and the enormous investment that most have staked into the development of the county. The flood risk map also shows that not just the region in the 100-year flood plain (Special Flood Hazard Area) is at high risk as predicted by FEMA’s flood map, but other areas around the mid-belt region of the country.
